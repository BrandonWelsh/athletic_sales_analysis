## Program Goals
"You'll analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years. Next, you'll determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, you'll determine which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear." (copied from Bootcamp Spot Module 5 Challenge Instructions page)

## Resources Utilized
This section is dedicated to keep track of what I used to help complete this program.



## Bugs
The instructions wanted me to combine the two DataFrames by the rows using an inner join (pd.merge). However, the output kept showing blank, with only column names and no data. I couldn't get it to work so I just did pd.concat and it worked so I went with it. I commented out my old pd.merge and left it in there.


## Update Log
11/28/2023: Created github repo. Took a look at the starter code. Realized it's still titled "..._starter_code" and I would've changed it if I hadn't already pushed my local repo to github and I have no idea if renaming it now will screw it up so I'm just gonna leave it.

11/30/2023: Finished part 1: Combine and clean the data
