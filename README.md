## Program Goals
"You'll analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years. Next, you'll determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, and which retailers sold the most women's athletic footwear. Finally, you'll determine which day and week had the highest sales for women's athletic footwear." (copied from Bootcamp Spot Module 5 Challenge Instructions page)

This was a fairly straightforward assignment, and much of it was copying previous code and altering it. Getting the starter groupby and pivot tables were the tricky part, then copying and modifying them for all of the rest of the questions was very straightforward. I used AI the least on this assignment out of any I have done yet. I used it only to help me with setting up the rename function and it also informed me that it was going to be easier to sort column separately rather than within the groupby/pivot that I was trying to do so I listened to it and it saved me probably 20 minutes.

## Bugs
The instructions wanted me to combine the two DataFrames by the rows using an inner join (pd.merge). However, the output kept showing blank, with only column names and no data. I couldn't get it to work so I just did the inner merge using pd.concat and it worked so I went with it. I commented out my old pd.merge and left it in there.

No bugs otherwise, it just works.

## Update Log
11/28/2023: Created github repo. Took a look at the starter code. Realized it's still titled "..._starter_code" and I would've changed it if I hadn't already pushed my local repo to github and I have no idea if renaming it now will screw it up so I'm just gonna leave it.

11/30/2023: Finished part 1: Combine and clean the data.

12/3/2023: Planned on just getting a few more sections done, got on a roll and finished the entire rest of the assignment instead.
